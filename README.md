## Overview

### Documentation

Checkout the [documentation](https://ramymounir.com/docs/streamer/) of STREAMER modules to learn more details about how to use our codebase.

### Installation

```bash
pip install streamer-torch # with pip from PyPI
pip install git+'https://github.com/ramyamounir/streamer-torch' # with GitHub
```

### Inference

> Note: Pretrained weights are coming soon..


```python
from streamer.models.inference_model import InferenceModel

model = InferenceModel(checkpoint='to/checkpoint/path/')
result = model(filename='to/video/file/path')
```


### Training

In order to perform training with streamer:

1. Use the [Dataset README.md](https://github.com/ramyamounir/streamer-torch/blob/main/streamer/preprocessing/README.md) to preprocess datasets for streaming loading and evaluation.
2. Use the provided [training script](https://github.com/ramyamounir/streamer-torch/blob/main/train.py) to train on multiple gpus (i.e., or multi-node).
3. The script [compare.py](https://github.com/ramyamounir/streamer-torch/blob/main/streamer/experiments/) can be used to evaluate the model's prediction using Hierarchical Level Reduction.

> Bash scripts with CLI arguments are provided in [helper_scripts](https://github.com/ramyamounir/streamer-torch/tree/main/helper_scripts)
